    <h1>Heart Disease Datatable (Modified)</h1>
    <h2>This dataset is different to the one used in the hardcoded version</h2>
    <h4>thsi data set</h4>
    <p>This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle which is a well known and trusted source for gathering datasets. 

        this dataset was chosen as its attributes were similar to the ones already implemented in the previous predictor (stroke and diabetes). This particular datatable was great since it had a wide range of different attributes that could potentially create a more advanced predictor. 
        As seen in the data table not only are ages of the patients provided each patient has been further categorised into age groups ; 30s, 40s etc. This feature appears throughout the dataset such as with chloesterol and bp levels
